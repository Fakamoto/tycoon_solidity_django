This is a `blockchain` tycoon-styled game made with `Solidity`, `Django`, and `Brownie`.

It is my first blockchain project and the first Smart Contract that I made all by myself, after 1 week of study of the Solidity programming language.

This is a nice example of an integration of `Django` and `Brownie API` to make a `blockchain` mini-game.
I am not a front-end developer so please don't focus on the looks of the app.

### To run the app, you just have to run in your command line the next line:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### then go to tycoon_game/game/ directory and run:

```
cd ./game
python3 manage.py runserver
```
